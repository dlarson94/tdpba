This matchup for the TDP Basketball Association Finals features two long-term rivals: The Where's Warrens vs. the Schweddy Bois. Let's take an in-depth look on the players. 

# Where's Warrens

## Team Captain - Justin Katz (C)
### <span style="color: #500000">University of Texas A&M</span>
#### Preseason Stats: -- PPG | -- APG | --  RPG
_No scouting information available_

## 1st pick 2018 Draft - Michael Fortman (SF)
### <span style="color: #c5050c">University of Wisonsin</span>
#### Preseason Stats: 14.1 PPG | 6.0 APG | 7.2  RPG
Fortman looks to be the second coming of Lebron James. As a forward who can both pull up or score the layup, Fortman looks to be an unstoppable threat. Look for the offense to go through Fortman. This young rookie will go down in history as one of the John Walls, Lebron James, and Anthony Davises of the basketball world. There will be children growing up with his poster who want to be "Like Mike."

# Schweddy Bois

## Team Captain - Oron Hazi (C)
### <span style="color: #841617">University of Oklahoma</span>
#### Preseason Stats: -- PPG | -- APG | --  RPG

## 2nd pick 2018 draft - Ian Kwan (SG) <span class="out">Out</span>
### <span style="color: #bf5700">University of Texas - Austin</span>
#### Preseason Stats: 16.0 PPG | 4.4 APG | 3.3  RPG
After a season ending ankle injury, Kwan has yet to see hardwood in over 2 months. Before his injury, he was a lights-out shooter. With a strong build, guards fail to manage his strength, while big men can't keep up with Kwan. With a quick release, he is not someone you can leave open. Whether he can return to MVP caliber play is questionable, but if he can return to his previous play, look for the Schweddy Bois to be a contender.

## 4th pick 2018 draft - Sidd Sharma (SF)
### <span style="color: #CC0033">University of Arizona</span>
#### Preseason Stats: 2.5 PPG | 0.2 APG | 1.9  RPG
With a body like Kevin Durant, Sidd possesses the physical capability to be a threat at the forward position. He is convinced that he _can indeed dunk_, but with no career games under his belt, this young rookie still has a lot to prove. Unfortunately, Sharma has not developed his skills well enough for such comparison. There's a lot of potential in Sharma and requires a good shooting coach to develop his skills.

### <span style="color: #0021A5">University of Florida</span>

## Undrafted 2018 Draft - Reece Alan Boyd (SF)
### <span style="color: #0066cc">Middle Tennessee State University</span>
#### Preseason Stats: -- PPG | -- APG | --  RPG

## Undrafted 2018 Draft - Thomas Doan (PG)
### <span style="color: #bf5700">University of Texas - Austin</span>
#### Preseason Stats: -- PPG | -- APG | --  RPG

# Notable Free Agents

## Warren Crasta (PG)
### <span style="color: #bf5700">University of Texas - Austin</span>
After getting drafted last in the 2018 draft, Crasta decided to take his talent overseas, to his house. As his hours in the day grew scarce, so did his passion for the game. After winning a championship in college, Crasta has yet to return to the game he once loved. Consider him a third string point guard if you require more depth at the point.
